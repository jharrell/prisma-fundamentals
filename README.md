# Prisma Fundamentals

This repository contains a course designed to be a comprehensive training for Prisma targeted at new or intermediate users looking to build their skills. This course is also intended to be a comprehensive preperation for the Prisma Certified Professional.

The course uses [Remark.js](https://remarkjs.com/) to render the slides which are written in markdown `/training` folders. Slides can be accessed through [github pages](https://prisma.github.io/prisma-fundamentals). Local development on these documents can by done by a local web server from inside the `/training` folder.

The recommended solution to local development is the [LiveServer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) in VSCode essentially serves up the directory in a local file server.

> This [extension](https://github.com/ritwickdey/live-server-web-extension) for Google Chrome or Firefox allows you to set up live-reload on save.

To open up a specific set of slides, simple head to `http://localhost:<port>/training/index.html?section=<folder-name>`.

The labs are built on [Instruqt](https://instruqt.com/). Reach out to sales@prisma.io for access. Development of these labs can be done by using the [Instruqt CLI](https://docs.instruqt.com/reference/software-development-kit-sdk) to push the configuration up to Instruqt. The labs use [codercom/code-server](https://hub.docker.com/r/codercom/code-server) container image along with the setup, check, and solve scripts in the appropriate folder for the lab within the /instruqt folder.
