# Prisma Fundamentals
This repository contains a course designed to be a comprehensive training for Prisma targeted at new or intermediate users looking to build their skills. This course is also intended to be a comprehensive preperation for the Prisma Certified Professional.

The course uses [Remark.js](https://remarkjs.com/) to render the slides which are written in markdown within the /docs folder. Slides can be accessed through [github pages](https://prisma.github.io/prisma-fundamentals). Local development on these documents can by done by a local web server from inside the docs folder such as the one included with Python:

####Python 3
python -m http.server

####Python 2
python -m SimpleHTTPServer

The labs are built on [Instruqt](https://instruqt.com/). Reach out to sales@prisma.io for access. Development of these labs can be done by using the [Instruqt CLI](https://docs.instruqt.com/reference/software-development-kit-sdk) to push the configuration up to Instruqt. The labs use [codercom/code-server](https://hub.docker.com/r/codercom/code-server) container image along with the setup, check, and solve scripts in the appropriate folder for the lab within the /instruqt folder.
